# Spiderman-web-cursor-effect
This is a fun and visually appealing project that creates a dynamic "Spiderman web" effect on the screen. As you move your mouse cursor, lines emanate from various dots, simulating the webs of Spiderman. The lines disappear as you continue to move the cursor, creating a smooth and engaging animation. The design is inspired by the Spiderman character, with a dark background and colorful dots. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the desired effect, showcasing your ability to create interactive web elements. It's a great example of how to combine design and functionality to create a visually engaging and interactive experience for users.

# Introduction
This project creates a dynamic "Spiderman web" effect on the screen, where lines emanate from various dots to the cursor, simulating the webs of Spiderman. The lines disappear as you continue to move the cursor, creating a smooth and engaging animation.

# Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

# How it Works
# Step 1: HTML Structure
The project starts with a basic HTML structure, consisting of a single index.html file. This file contains a canvas element, which is used to render the web effect.

# Step 2: CSS Styling
The CSS file (style.css) is used to add basic styling to the project, including setting the background color and font styles.

# Step 3: JavaScript Logic
The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic for creating the web effect. It uses the following steps to achieve this:

# Dot Generation: 
Random dots are generated on the canvas, which will serve as the starting points for the web lines.
# Line Generation: 
When the user moves the cursor, lines are drawn from the dots to the cursor position.
# Line Animation: 
The lines are animated to create a smooth, dynamic effect.
# Line Removal: 
As the user continues to move the cursor, the previous lines are removed, creating a sense of continuity.
# Step 4: Event Listeners
Event listeners are added to the canvas to track the user's cursor movements. When the cursor is moved, the JavaScript logic is triggered to generate new lines and remove old ones.

# Features
Dynamic web effect that responds to cursor movement
Random dot generation for a unique experience each time
Smooth animation and line removal for a seamless effect

# Getting Started
To run this project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Move your cursor around the screen to see the web effect in action!
